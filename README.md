### bVisor is an in-process linux sandbox.

bVisor is an SDK and runtime for securely running Linux sandboxes, locally.

Inspired by [gVisor](https://github.com/google/gVisor), bVisor runs workloads directly on the host machine, providing isolation by intercepting and virtualizing [linux syscalls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call) from userspace, allowing for secure and isolated I/O without the overhead of a virtual machine or remote infra.

Unlike gVisor, bVisor is built to run directly in your application, spinning up and tearing down sandboxes in milliseconds. This makes it ideal for ephemeral tasks commonly performed by LLM agents, such as code execution or filesystem operations.

## Architecture

bVisor is built on [Seccomp user notifier](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html), a Linux kernel feature that allows userspace processes to intercept and optionally handle syscalls from a child process. This allows bVisor to block or mock the kernel API (such as filesystem read/write, network access, etc.) to ensure the child process remains sandboxed. 

Other than the overhead of syscall emulation, child processes run natively.

### Goal

bVisor is ~complete once it can embed into higher-level languages, such as python or typescript, as an alternative "bash" subprocess runner.

For example, embedded into a python SDK:
```python
from bvisor import Sandbox

with Sandbox() as sb:
    sb.bash("echo 'Hello, world!'")
    sb.bash("ls /")  # serves virtual "/"
    sb.bash("touch /tmp/test.txt")
    sb.bash("curl https://www.google.com")
    sb.bash("npm install")
    sb.bash("sleep 5")

    try:
        sb.bash("chroot /tmp")  # blocked
    except Exception as e:
        pass  # as expected
```

Or similarly in typescript:
```typescript
import { Sandbox } from "bvisor";

using sb = await Sandbox.create();

await sb.bash("echo 'Hello, world!'");
// etc ...
```

## Status

bVisor is an early proof-of-concept. Core syscall interception works via seccomp. Process isolation works via virtual namespaces. Now just working through the laundry list of misc syscalls.


#### 1. Process Visibility Isolation - *in progress*

Sandboxed processes can only see and signal other processes within the same namespace. Processes use real kernel PIDs, but namespace boundaries control visibility.

- [x] Virtual namespaces with parent/child relationships.
- [x] `kill` restricted to processes within namespace
- [x] `/proc` reads filtered to visible processes only
- [x] `clone`/`fork` inherit namespaces, mimicking real kernel behavior
- [x] Per-process virtual FD tables
- [ ] `wait4`/`waitid` for process reaping
- [ ] `execve` for program execution

#### 2. Copy-on-Write Filesystem - *in progress*

bVisor is imageless, meaning it does not require a base image to run. It runs with direct visibility to the host filesystem. This allows system dependencies such as `npm` to work out of the box.

Isolation is achieved via a copy-on-write overlay on top of the host filesystem. Files opened with write flags are copied to a sandbox-local directory. Read-only files are passed through to the real filesystem. 

- [x] Path normalization (blocks `..` traversal attacks)
- [x] `openat` with path-based allow/block rules
- [ ] COW (copy-on-write) layer for write operations
- [ ] Storage backend for COW (plans for /tmp, local, s3)
- [ ] FD operations (`read`, `write`, `close`, `dup`, `lseek`, `fstat`, `fcntl`)
- [ ] Directory operations (`getcwd`, `chdir`, `mkdirat`, `unlinkat`, `getdents64`)

#### 3. Network Isolation - *not started*

- [ ] Block or virtualize network syscalls
- [ ] Optional allowlist for specific hosts/ports

#### 4. Resource Limits (cgroups) - *not started*

- [ ] CPU/memory limits
- [ ] I/O throttling

### Infrastructure

**Core**
- [x] Seccomp user notifier interception
- [x] Supervisor/child process model
- [x] BPF filter installation
- [x] Cross-process memory access (`process_vm_readv`/`writev`)
- [x] `writev` emulation (stdout/stderr capture)

**Blocked Dangerous Syscalls**
- [x] `ptrace`, `mount`, `umount2`, `chroot`, `pivot_root`, `setns`, `unshare`, `seccomp`, `reboot`

**Passthrough** (kernel handles directly)
- [x] Memory: `brk`, `mmap`, `mprotect`, `munmap`
- [x] Time: `clock_gettime`, `gettimeofday`, `nanosleep`
- [x] Identity: `getuid`, `geteuid`, `getgid`, `getegid`
- [x] Runtime: `getrandom`, `uname`, `futex`, `prlimit64`

### Platform Support

- [x] Linux (aarch64, x86_64)
- [ ] macOS - requires alternative to seccomp (no equivalent exists)

### SDK

- [ ] Compile runtime for distribution
- [ ] Python bindings
- [ ] TypeScript bindings
